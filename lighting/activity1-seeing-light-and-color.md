# Part 1: Seeing Light and Shadow in a grey scale
- Place the Styrofoam ball a few inches from one side of the set up box.
- Position the lamp on your set up so that it creates distinct shadows on and around the ball.
- Take a photo with your phone and print that photo.
- Trace the outline (using pencil, pen or marker) of at least 8 distinct shadow shapes.
- Identify which is the lightest shadow, the darkest shadow and all of the gradations between.
- Sketch out the areas of shadow to match the level of darkness (known as value) that you see.
- Optional painting step: Trace a second copy of your image. Place the paper on piece of cardboard and paint the shapes; from darkest area to lightest area using white and black paint.
