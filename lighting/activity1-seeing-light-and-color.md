# Part 1: Seeing Light and Shadow in a grey scale
- Place the Styrofoam ball a few inches from one side of the set up box.
- Position the lamp on your set up so that it creates distinct shadows on and around the ball.
- Take a photo with your phone and print that photo.
- Trace the outline (using pencil, pen or marker) of at least 8 distinct shadow shapes.
- Identify which is the lightest shadow, the darkest shadow and all of the gradations between.
- Sketch out the areas of shadow to match the level of darkness (known as value) that you see.
- Optional painting step: Trace a second copy of your image. Place the paper on piece of cardboard and paint the shapes; from darkest area to lightest area using white and black paint.

# Part 2: Color
- Do the same exercise as above but this time add colored paper to the sides of the set up box and see how color influences the white ball and its shadows.
- Take a photo, print and trace the outlines as before. You must observe the regions of light and shadow very carefully.
- Use colored pencils to fill in the shapes in order to match the color in your image as best you can.
- Optional painting step: Trace another copy of your image on a new piece of paper. Try painting in the shapes that you outlined with the appropriate color. To make this easier you should use a spot screen to identify the color you are seeing within the shadows.
