# Part 1: Analysis

## Questions for the Viewer
- What can you tell about the story by looking at the color script?

The script has a lot of dark blues and lighter oranges. Thus, it seems that there will be a lot of contrast between good and evil, or hope and sadness, in the story. (Trying to detach myself from the perspective of having already seen the movie)
  
- What does it tell you about the overall tone & feel of the movie?

It tackles some serious topics, but also leaves room for warmth and light. There will probably be a positive message at the end. 

- Select three frames that have very different moods and explain what they make you feel and how color and light was used.

## Part 2: Practice
- Below are three rough frames from the story reel for the short film Piper. Pick one of the three frames, print it out and color it in to create two distinct looks. What moods were you able to portray?

## Part 3: Generate
- Do you have an idea for your own story? Or a story that you've read that you'd like to think about designing the lighting for? Apply what you've learned here and create a color script for it!
- Keep in mind that you donâ€™t need to draw to make a great color script, even a photo collage would work. Choose images that reference how you imagine color, light and shadow would be used for each key moment in the story. Or, feel free to draw each frame.
