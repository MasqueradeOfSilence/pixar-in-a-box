# Part 1: Analysis

## Questions for the Viewer
- What can you tell about the story by looking at the color script?

The script has a lot of dark blues and lighter oranges. Thus, it seems that there will be a lot of contrast between good and evil, or hope and sadness, in the story. (Trying to detach myself from the perspective of having already seen the movie)
  
- What does it tell you about the overall tone & feel of the movie?

It tackles some serious topics, but also leaves room for warmth and light. There will probably be a positive message at the end. 

- Select three frames that have very different moods and explain what they make you feel and how color and light was used.

  The very first frame consists of bright colors, clear skies, and sun. It is vibrant yet peaceful, evoking a beautiful and warm day. Generally feels happy.

  The hammock frame is almost entirely gray, washed-out grayish-blue, and white. Black shadows in the foreground add to the feeling of somberness and foreboding. The light coming from the city is harsh and austere, but beautiful.

  The frame with Ernesto in his cowboy hat, with his hand outstretched, is threatening and ominous. It is lit from the back as well as underneath to create scary, harsh lighting. Similar to the frame discussed above, the color is blue, evoking somberness. The background is blurred / using DOF such that Ernesto himself is emphazied. 

## Part 2: Practice
- Below are three rough frames from the story reel for the short film Piper. Pick one of the three frames, print it out and color it in to create two distinct looks. What moods were you able to portray?

  I went for a more lighthearted, summery color scheme here. It's a bit difficult with how franctic the poor sandpiper looks, but the idea is that it's more of a normal obstacle that all pipers experience, and he will have fun after getting used to the waves.

  I tried to make it more gray and bleak here. 

## Part 3: Generate
- Do you have an idea for your own story? Or a story that you've read that you'd like to think about designing the lighting for? Apply what you've learned here and create a color script for it!
- Keep in mind that you donâ€™t need to draw to make a great color script, even a photo collage would work. Choose images that reference how you imagine color, light and shadow would be used for each key moment in the story. Or, feel free to draw each frame.

I'll use Carnivile again. I am choosing the photo collage option in the interest of focusing on getting to CtrlPaint, since that's long overdue. 

General color scheme: reds, blacks, blues, and dark purples. Generally a very somber, stormy, autumnal atmosphere, especially as the Augenstorms' approach at the end of autumn is a plot point throughout.
