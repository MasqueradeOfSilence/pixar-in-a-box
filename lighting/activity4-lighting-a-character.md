# Activity 4: Lighting a character

This one took me a minute to finally do. Turns out, I'm not the biggest fan of constructing physical lighting setups...because you have to do everything right then and there, or else you'll have a bunch of lamps and toys on the floor until you finish it. I like everything nice and neat, and stored digitally on my PC. 

## Return to your live action set but now swap out the orange for a toy character. Now try lighting your character in at least two different ways: 
### Can you get them to cast a long shadow or look mysterious?
My github images are not rendering right now idk why

### Can you light the character to look scary?
### Can you light the character to look flat (no sharp shadows)?
### If you change the color of the light on the character how does that impact your scene?

Remember to take pictures so that you can compare how your character looks under your various lighting setups. Give your images a name.

(I did not do the optional outdoor setup as I am *really* ready to get digital at this point!)
