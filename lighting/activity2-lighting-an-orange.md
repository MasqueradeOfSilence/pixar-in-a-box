# Part 1: Examining light roles
- Start in a dark room
- Place an orange a few inches from one side of the set up box.
- Position one light to act as your key.
- Move your key so that it comes from different places such as from the same place as your camera or from directly above your set.
- Observe how this changes the shadows on and around the orange.
- Pick your favorite position.
- Position a second light to act as your fill
- Observe how this changes the value of the shadows
- If the light is too bright try putting a piece of cloth or paper over it.
- Position a third light to act as a rim and/or kick.
- **Optional:** Put colored paper or plastic in front of the lights to see if you can change the feeling of the scene.
- Take a picture of your set up once you are happy with it. Give it a name!
