# Part A: Pick a scene or sequence from one of your favorite movies, review it, and answer the following questions:
## Scene: Sixth Station train scene from Spirited Away
•	Can you find a moment where changing shot types (wide shot, medium shot, close-up) help emphasis a story point? 

  - The transition between Chihiro and No Face sitting down together in the train (close shot), and the train speeding through the water (medium shot). She is willing to accompany this lonely spirit as they take a ride together on the speeding train. Thus, context is provided for the characters, the immediate setting, and the surrounding setting. 
  
•	How does the staging and framing heighten the emotional impact of the scene?

  - Building off of (1): The shots often switch between close-ups between Chihiro and No Face and sweeping, beautifully illustrated views of the train and surrounding landscape. 
  
  - These two primary shot types, close and wide, help emphasize both the emotions of Chihiro and No Face – and the connection that they feel with each other, unlike everyone else on the train – as well as the loneliness of the train ride itself. 
  
•	Can you find a shot where the rule of thirds is followed?

  - When Chihiro takes one last look at the tower, she is off to the left with the tower at the right. It is a visually stunning shot that shows the beauty of the landscape and her emotions upon leaving. 

## Part B: Return to the minor beats you identified in your story from the previous exercise. For each beat choose a shot type which would work well (wide, medium, close) and then do the following:

- Sketch the frame for each of these three shots from the camera’s point of view. Remember to consider what you want the audience to know, and what you want them to feel.
- Consider using either “centering” or “rule of thirds” to place your subjects within the frame.
- To help you visualize the staging, imagine looking down on each of the three shot types. Put the camera and character(s) where you imagine they need to be in order to create the shot type. Add any notes, lines, or details that would indicate direction for camera or character.

This is where I regretted breaking down the scenes into so many beats. Also, pardon my horrendous figure drawing skills which will be worked on a few tutorials later in my art self-study. I do wish that PIAB would have some technical drawing foundation sections.
