# Part A: Choose a scene from one of your favorite films which contains an extreme shot or angle.
- Scene: Great Spirits from Brother Bear

## What kind of extreme shots or angles are used? 

- Extreme wide shots! Often looking down, whether or not at an angle. 

## How do these shots help the story?

- As a way to introduce the landscape and way of life of Kenai’s people. They show what daily life is like, both for the people and for the animals and nature that surround them. 

## What emotional effect do they have?
- Their biggest purpose is to elicit a sense of wonder, awe, and fascination among the viewers.

## When looking at framing of these shots, can you identify where aspects of Visual Language (line, shape, space, movement, tone and color) are used to create emphasis and lead the viewer’s eye?
- Rule of thirds is used a lot, for example to frame the positioning of canoers, rams, and birds. 
- Color is used to illuminate the canoers, drawing the viewer’s attention to the brighter part of the water in which they sit. Same with the lines coming from behind them. The rams are illuminated similarly. It looks like a sunrise or sunset scene, and most likely sunrise. 
- Wide open spaces elicit a feeling of untouched beauty and a people living in harmony with nature. 
- Lots of movement of the living things as well as water, etc. while the trees and rocks remain unmoving – showing that despite the many changes, nature often appears constant and unmoving. 

# Part B: Return to the minor beats from your own story you identified in the previous exercises.

## Identify at least one minor beat where you think an extreme shot or angle might work well.

- When Parker stops at the tall bridge over Bearthicket River, his turnaround point for his run, to do swings. 

## Why did you choose this shot from a story perspective?

- An extreme wide angle may work well here, eventually zooming into him doing the exercises. This can introduce the forested lands that he comes from, as this will be our first meeting of him. 

## How do you think the shot will help emphasis the emotional impact of that moment?

- Similar to the Brother Bear scene, I hope that it elicits a sense of wonder. It should also show that despite the natural wonders around him, Parker feels out of place. He is very small compared to the mountains, forest, and river all around him.
