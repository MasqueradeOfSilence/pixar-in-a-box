# Part A: Find a scene from one of your 3 favorite movies that creates drama by using dynamic shots.

- Turtle Cruising from Finding Nemo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6go9eFUIIU 

## What kind of dynamic shots are used in this scene?

- Tracking shots! Lots of tracking shots as you move along with Marlin and the turtles in the EAC. 

## How do these shots improve the storytelling?

- They show a key part of the narrative – that Marlin has achieved his objective in finding the EAC and is on his way to Sydney. 

## Do these shots affect the emotional impact of the scene?

- They make it feel thrilling, as you ride along the current with the turtles, often in the POV of riding on their back. If you lose yourself enough in the visuals, it can actually feel like you’re riding it with them (or at least it feels that way to me). 

# Part B: Identify a moment in your own story where you might want to use dynamic shots. 

- Roller coaster scene 

## What kind of camera movement would be most effective? Why?

- Tracking shots, because the characters will be interacting with each other as they ride the roller coaster
- The camera might be a little shaky as well to match the experience of riding a coaster

## What effect will this have on your story?

- It will be the first introduction to Soulhooks as well as a ride that does not directly kill its riders
- It will make it feel thrilling much like the Finding Nemo scene. It will also up the horror as the feeling of motion is combined with what they see while riding the attraction, and the fear of being stuck inside the bodies forever.
