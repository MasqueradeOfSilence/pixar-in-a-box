# Activity 1: Major and Minor Beats

## Part A: Pick a scene or sequence from one of your three favorite movies and do the following: 

Scene: Dory speaks whale

- What is the major beat in the story that it depicts? 

Dory speaks to the whale to ask for help with finding Nemo.

- Breaks this major beat down into a bullet point list of minor beats. Each minor beat represents one event or idea. 

1) Dory sees the whale in the distance, attempts to greet it, and gets Marlin to do so as well.
2) She tells the whale in English that they need help finding Nemo. 
3) They realize he's a lot bigger than they thought, and farther away. 
4) Whale makes a noise. 
5) Dory starts speaking in whale now. 
6) Marlin tells her that she's crazy and that she's not speaking whale.
7) The whale seems to start swimming away.
8) Dory tries to speak in a different dialect to the whale.
9) Marlin tries to get her to stop, telling her she's crazy. 
10) Dory tries other dialects. 
11) Whale starts to loom behind them.
12) Marlin expresses fear of getting eating by the whale.
13) Dory says that whales only eat krill. 
14) A bunch of krill run by, saying to swim away. 
15) The whale comes from behind them.
16) They get sucked into its mouth. 

## Part B: Pick two major beats from your own story spine and break them down into a bullet point list of minor beats. 

- Beat 1: Selene finally convinces Parker to go through the portal to her world.

1) Parker is on his 5-mile morning run before work. 
2) He stops at the tall bridge over Bearthicket River, his turnaround point, to do swings.
3) Selene appears to him. 
4) She asks for him to come visit her world. 
5) He tells her she's not real and she should go away. 
6) She gets offended and casts a portal at the bridge's railing. 
7) She shoves Parker off the bridge and holds him there using telekinesis. 
8) Slightly more convinced, Parker agrees to go through the portal. 
9) They jump through the portal. 
10) They end up in Selene's backyard.

- Beat 2: Roller coaster ride. 

1) Tim invites the rest of the group (Katia, Lang, Selene, Parker, Shane, and Linda) to accompany him on the wooden roller coaster. 
2) They agree.
3) Linda asks how exactly they embark on the ride when no one ever seems to get on or off of it, and the same people are riding it for eternity. 
4) Tim explains that it's through possession, and that the bodies on the roller coaster are mostly deceased. 
5) They walk into the entrance dock. 
6) They detach their souls from their bodies using the Soulhooks.
7) They float through the air and land in their chosen bodies as the ride starts
8) Parker lands in a body, not cognizant of the soul trapped within.
9) The soul leaves in delight, thanking Parker. 
10) They experience horrors while on the attraction.
11) Parker notices his abandoned body on the side of the attraction and gets sick. 
12) Tim adds that if they don't detach before the final tunnel, they will be stuck in the bodies forever unless someone else comes to replace them. 
13) Parker panics, but everyone manages to detach in time. 
14) They re-enter their bodies. 

These will not be included in this section, so I won't storyboard them for the next activity, but I need to remember them: 

15) Privately, Selene suggests that something like the Soulhooks could be responsible for the zombie-like, demonic state of the carnival's inhabitants.
16) Lang thinks that it's connected to the tallest ride in the park, because he sees it flickering whenever someone dies.
