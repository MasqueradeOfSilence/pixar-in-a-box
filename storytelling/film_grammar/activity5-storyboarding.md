# Part A: Finally, it’s time to apply what you’ve learned and practiced to the story idea you’re developing. For this exercise you should set aside at least an hour where you can really focus on your storyboarding.

- Choose a scene from your story and break it down into minor beats. Each beat should represent one or two shots.
- 
# Part B: As seen in the previous video work through visualizing the staging, framing, and motion used to communicate each idea in the scene using simplified drawings.

- For the first iterations, go ahead and make lots of mistakes so you get them out of the way as you continue to rework and refine your scenes.
- 
- Go ahead and add descriptive words that would help others understand and follow your vision.
- 
- Use lines, arrows, frames within frames, directional lines, etc. that would visually indicate direction, shot types, or anything else needed to convey your ideas.
- 
- You can find plenty of blank storyboard templates online, or you can draw your own. You can also use index cards, which are easier to pin up and move around when you want to show it to someone else.
