# Part B: Think about a difficult choice you had to make in your own life. What was at stake?

Mission -- 2 years of my life, having to face social anxiety and ADHD head-on 

# Part C: Return to one of the obstacles your character might face from the previous exercise. Now think of the choice this obstacle forces them to make. Answer the following:

- What are the possible stakes of this choice?

(Fighting the carnival): He could die or lose his soul doing so, instead of being safe (but depressed and alone) in his home world. 

- Can you come up with an internal, external or philosophical stake which applies to this choice?

Internal: If he does not choose to stay with Selene and save her world, he will have to return to his old life of fear, sadness, and mundanity. 
External: The carnival could kill him, or Take his soul and give it to the Ringmaster, while no one is saved. 
Philosophical: If they do nothing, the carnival will continue killing people across the galaxies and Realities, for millennia to come.
