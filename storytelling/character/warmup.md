# Step 1: Pick a character from one of your favorite films. How would they respond to being trapped in an elevator? Draw or write a single page about what happens.

Ash Ketchum from the Pokemon TV show and movie: I suspect he would release his Pokemon (there's no way he'd be alone in there) and have them help him escape from the elevator. Alternately, if he could call someone from his PokeNav, he probably would. 

He would probably get frustrated, but not panic. He might suspect someone else of doing this to him, as opposed to it just occuring as a result of a mechanical or electrical failure. 

I could see him, as a go-getter and problem solver, getting out of there pretty quickly -- using brute force if nothing else. 

# Step 2: Return to a character you are in the process of creating and do the same thing.

For whatever reason, I find this easier to do with my own characters. 

Parker Jones (Carnivile): (Idea = at first trying to find a rational solution to the problem, then quickly escalating into panic.) 

The elevator stopped, but the LED display did not light up with the floor number. Frowning, Parker pressed the button for the ground floor again. Why wasn't it working? It wasn't even lighting up. This was not a good use of time. He had so much to do. He punched the button with his fist this time. Nothing. Feeling his breathing escalate, he began to punch it again and again, eventually hissing in frustration and slumping against the wall. It wasn't working. 

*Idiot. I should have taken the stairs. Would've been better for my fitness anyway.* 

He tried the button one more time, even though he knew it wasn't going to work. And of course, it didn't. *Nothing ever goes my way. I can't do anything right.* Was it a power failure? But the lights were still on. Maybe they were using a different line for the elevator power and electricity. He just didn't know. 

*I need to get out of here*, he thought, his mind beginning to race. *What if this thing runs out of oxygen?* Sure, it would take around 33-34 hours for that to happen. But he didn't want to take his chances. 

It would also be terrifying if the power surged back on and the elevator dropped, slamming him against the roof. But between that and running out of oxygen -- he'd take the former. 

*Okay, stop hyperventilating, that will make the oxygen deplete faster*, he thought, forcing himself to breathe normally. But even that didn't calm his racing heart. He had to think logically. *How can I get out of here? Let's see if the emergency number they gave me works.* He pulled out his phone, texting the number for emergency relief. I AM STUCK IN THE ELEVATOR. PLEASE SEND HELP. 

CONFIRMED, read the reply text. WE WILL SEND A TECHNICIAN TO HELP YOU SHORTLY. Parker breathed a sigh of relief. As long as they got here within 33 hours, he would be fine. Though for the sake of water, food, showering, and using the restroom, he sure hoped it would be a lot faster.
