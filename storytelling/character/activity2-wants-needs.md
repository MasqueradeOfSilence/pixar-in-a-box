# Part A: Return to the main characters from your three favorite films. Identify a want and a need for each character.
(For example: In Monsters Inc. Sulley wants to be the best scarer but he needs to be a father figure.) 

Lilo = wants to be accepted by others, wants her parents back. She needs to take care of this alien that has dropped into her life. 

Harry = wants to defeat Lord Voldemort, also needs to defeat Lord Voldemort. But, ultimately he also just wants a peaceful and fun Hogwarts experience, and Voldy rather complicates that for him. 

# Part B: Try to identify one of your own wants and needs.

Want = to succeed in animation, computer science, and creative writing. 
Need = to be healthier, physically and mentally. To finish graduate school with a high GPA. 

# Part C: Return to your character idea from the previous exercise. Brainstorm answers to the following questions:

- **What do they want most?** Parker wants safety, security, acceptance, learning, and love. 
- **Who do they want to become?** He doesn't want to be depressed anymore. He wants to become a great engineer. 
- **What might they need in order to succeed?** To overcome his fears and anxieties, to learn to trust others and himself, to believe in things that can't be immediately proven.
