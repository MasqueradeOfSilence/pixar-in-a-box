(Using Parker Jones) 

## External features:

- **Is your character a human, animal, object?** Human
- **What kind of clothing do they wear?** Pretty plain: t-shirts, jeans. 
- **How does your character move?** Looks down, doesn't make eye contact, moves pretty quickly due to being in great cardiovascular shape. 
- **What's the first thing you'd notice when looking at them from a distance?** You probably won't notice him at all, because he is not particularly garish in appearance, and blends in easily with crowds without trying. 

## Internal features:

- **What do they like to do?** Coding, running, hiking, reading, science, math, engineering, gaming, building PCs, exploring the forest. 
- **What do they fear?** Everything? Ha. Mostly new situations, and physical danger. 
- **What emotion do they most often feel?** FEAR, loneliness, and sadness. 
- **How would they respond if trapped in an elevator?** Panic at first, but his rationale would eventually win out and he would eventually logic his way to a good solution.
