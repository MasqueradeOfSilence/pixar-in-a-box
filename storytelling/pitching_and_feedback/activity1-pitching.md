# Activity 1: Pitching

## Part A: 

Take a scene that you storyboarded in Lesson 5 and practice pitching it first in front of a mirror, then to a close friend, then to someone who you don’t know as well, but is willing to listen and provide feedback. Here are some things to think about:

- Who are the characters and how can you make them distinctive? *The characters are Geteko, Tim, Selene, Katia, Parker, and Lang, so it's a busy scene with a lot of people interacting. Tim is malicious, but his goals align with our protagonists'. He will be seen as scheming and smart, but not as smart as the ancient and powerful wizard Geteko. Selene, Parker, and Lang are the supporting cast, and will probably just be referred to as 1 entity for the sake of this pitch, as they're more in the background. Katia is independent, strong-willed, and determined.*
- Pull out and highlight any dialogue between characters so it’s easily visible when you’re going through your scene. *Geteko's monologue can be quoted. Tim's rage over not killing Geteko himself, too.*
- What are some descriptive words you can use to help your audience use their imagination? *rage, darkness, scheme, deception, battle, magic.*
- What kind of energy can you bring to your pitch? Consider body movements, voice characteristics and sound effects. *Trying to get into the characters, especially Katia, Tim, and Geteko.* 
- Remember to pay attention to pacing; going through action scenes quickly while slowing down to let moodier moments breathe. *Most of the scene has a lot of action, but it starts off slow, so this part will go more slowly.*

I completed the 3 pitches.
