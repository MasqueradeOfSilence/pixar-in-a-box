# Part A: Practicing giving & receiving feedback with someone who has a storyboard to pitch. 

## You can do this with a friend, partner, or in small groups. After youâ€™re done listening, follow the steps below:
- Start with the positive by giving specific examples of things that you liked, things that are working particularly well.
- Make it personal. That is, make it clear this is your personal perspective.
- Be specific with your feedback.
- Make suggestions for the storyteller to consider, as opposed to dictating what you think should happen. Ask questions

I received feedback from my brother for my scene. It was a bit odd pitching a scene from my story instead of the entire thing. He wanted more details of the action and suggested some philosophical questions, and wondered about some character motivations.

As I am completing Pixar in a Box on my own, I did not specifically give feedback. However, I have tons of practice doing this from my creative writing minor and the two critique groups I work with weekly.
