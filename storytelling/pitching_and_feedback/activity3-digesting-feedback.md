# Part A: Review your thoughts from the feedback activity by identifying the main notes you received and then try the following:

- Try starting with the “easiest” notes and work your way down to the harder, more difficult to digest feedback notes.
- For each note, how can you make changes that address the spirit of the note?
- Come up with more than one possibility and try them out before honing in on the best solution.
- Finally, re-pitch your story to the same person or group of people and see how it flies. You may need to go through this process several times before you and your team are happy with the results.

## My rewrite
### FICTIONAL PITCH: 

- I am pitching this as a SINGLE SCENE within the context of an entire story. 

### PART 1: ESSENTIAL BACKSTORY

- The story involves 5 young people (teenager/YA) who are trapped in an evil carnival. This evil carnival is magical, and has the power to brainwash and mind control people. It can manipulate memories, and cause those under its spell to become obsessively devoted to it, never leaving the carnival. So they work and help the carnival operate in order to capture more people. 
- 3 of these people KNOW about this carnival's evil power, and they entered it PREPARED. So, they are using THEIR OWN magic to FIGHT BACK against the mind control. These 3 people are Selene, Parker, and Lang, who we will refer to as PLS for simplicity's sake. 
- The other 2 are teenagers, and they didn't know the carnival was evil, until they first entered and fell under its spell. They live at the carnival now, having been hypnotized to never leave. Their names are Katia and Tim, and we will refer to them as KT. 
- KT are trying to rise in the carnival’s ranks. They believe that with greater power, they will be able to serve the carnival better. 
- PLS befriend KT after entering the carnival. 


### PART 2: THE SCENE ITSELF

This is a battle scene in which a “big bad” is killed. 

- The 5 fighters (this is what we will call the whole group) are planning on taking down an elderly magician who is one of the 7 in charge of the carnival. The reason KT want to kill him is because Tim wants to replace him, and that’s how the carnival works — leaders can only be replaced when murdered. Katia wants to help him as a friend, and eventually do the same thing herself -- kill one of the 7 leaders to replace them. 
- This magician’s name is Geteko. 
- They devise a plan: Tim will slip a sleeping draught into Geteko’s drink. When he’s asleep, Tim will kill him with a spell. The others will serve as backup. PLS are hiding outside. 
- At first, it all goes according to plan. Geteko falls asleep and Tim is approaching with the killing spell. 
- Geteko wakes up, and jumps out of his rocking chair that he was sleeping in, springing at them. He laughs at them, telling them that he has built up partial immunity to the sleeping powder. After the first few minutes, he was just faking it. 
- A battle ensues. Geteko casts some attacking spells at them. Some hit, some are dodged. 
- Lang manages to freeze Geteko in place, but he breaks free before they can kill him. 
- Geteko gives his villain speech. He talks about how you always get abandoned by people, and how he didn’t choose the brain that led to his whole course of action. Philosophical thing. 
- Katia manages to find an opening when he is distracted by the other three, and Tim is knocked unconscious. She casts a spell and kills Geteko, instead of Tim. 
- She gains an incredible amount of magical power to take his place, feeling it course through her. 
- When Tim comes to, he is filled with rage, screaming and punching and cursing, because he didn't get to kill Geteko and take his place. He isn’t mad at his friends though, but rather Geteko himself.
