# Part A: Vivid Memory

Carpinteria State Beach, camping: My cousin shone a flashlight into the night sky and told us that the beam would travel forever into space. 

Ocean, salt, campfires, cool breeze, darkness and light. 

Emotions: Wonder (is that really true? Google was rarely used back then), imagination, discovery, wanderlust. 

Note: I recently fact checked this [here](https://www.quora.com/If-I-shine-a-flashlight-up-to-outer-space-how-far-will-the-light-travel-Would-the-light-travel-for-infinity), and it is partially true! 

# Part B: Emotions Connected

Imagination, wonder, wanderlust. A feeling of safety. But more than anything, imagination. 

# Part C: Express -- Write the memory. 

I stood in the darkness, the lights of campfires doing little to obstruct the white stars that hung suspended in the sky. The air was cool, a breeze blowing off the ocean, bringing with it the scent of salt. 

My cousin stood beside me, his flashlight brighter than mine. He shone a beam into the dark abyss of the stars. "Did you know," he said, "that if you shine your flashlight up into the stars, and it doesn't hit anything, the light will go on forever?" 

Wordlessly, I stared up into the vast expanse. I lifted up my flashlight, and shone it into the sky, too. 

"What happens if it hits the moon?" I ask, angling my light towards the bright gray coin that illuminated the black sea. "If there's anyone on the moon, will they see it?" 

"Maybe," my cousin said. "But it will be really small." 

I nodded and angled my flashlight back towards an empty part of space, between two stars. I let the beam of light begin its journey into the abyss, hopefully forever, thinking of the lovely worlds it would find.
