# Part A: Vivid Memory

Carpinteria State Beach, camping: My cousin shone a flashlight into the night sky and told us that the beam would travel forever into space. 

Ocean, salt, campfires, cool breeze, darkness and light. 

Emotions: Wonder (is that really true? Google was rarely used back then), imagination, discovery, wanderlust. 

Note: I recently fact checked this [here](https://www.quora.com/If-I-shine-a-flashlight-up-to-outer-space-how-far-will-the-light-travel-Would-the-light-travel-for-infinity), and it is partially true! 

# Part B: Emotions Connected

Imagination, wonder, wanderlust. A feeling of safety. But more than anything, imagination. 

# Part C: Express -- Write the memory. 

I stood in the darkness, the lights of campfires doing little to obstruct the white stars that hung suspended in the sky.
