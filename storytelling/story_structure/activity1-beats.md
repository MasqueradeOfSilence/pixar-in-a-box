# Part B: Play the “Story Spine game” with a group of people. Go around in a circle and improv the development of a story. Start with “once upon a time” and have one person at a time spontaneously fill in the blank for each line.

(done, let's just say it involved a man-eating grizzly bear reforming his ways)

# Part C: Develop a story spine for your own film idea. Try sharing your spine with someone and iterating a few times…

Carnivile

Once upon a time...there was a girl who was kidnapped by a demonic carnival that she was visiting with her family. 

Every day...she would participate in the horrifying events of the carnival, growing in magical power, her memories wiped and brain mind-controlled to serve its purpose. 

Until one day...an old friend of hers, plus 2 others, came into the carnival to meet her and talk with her. While she could not remember her, they became friends once more. 

Because of that...she began to break free of the carnival's curse, and slowly shifted from wanting to rule the carnival to wanting to destroy it. 

Until finally...with the help of her friends, she battled the demons that ruled the carnival, and defeated them. 

And ever since then...she showed great love to her family and friends, and never again forgot who she was.
