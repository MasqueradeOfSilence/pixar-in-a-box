# Part A: Describe the moral or theme of your three favorite films. Can you identify the lesson that the main character(s) learns by the end of the film?

L: Family is the most important thing in the world, though it may not always be what you expect it to be. 

H: You need to fight for and protect the ones you love. 

FN: You need to overcome your fears for those you love. 

# Part B: Think of a story from your own life. What was the moral of your story? What did you learn and why?

Middle school bullying: I have intrinsic worth and value as an individual, even if other people don't recognize that. 

# Part C: Return to the story you are developing and try the following:

- Brainstorm ideas for the moral in your own story (return to the needs of your main character from the Character lesson)

Always be true to who you are

Overcome your fears 

Take care of the hurting inner child within you, lest it destroy you. 

Rescue your friends. 

- Try retelling your original story spine in order to reinforce (clarify) the moral at the end.

Once upon a time, there was a teenage girl who often felt out of place in her family and did not draw close to them. 

Every day, she would throw herself into her music, magic, and academics, but avoid close relationships with others. 

Until one day, she was Taken by an evil carnival. All of her memories were taken from her. 

Because of that, she grew into a brainwashed servant of the carnival and forgot everything, including her family and sense of self. 

Because of that, she did terrible things. 

Because of that, she would often feel extreme flashes of guilt and sadness but could not understand why. 

Until finally, her best friend came to rescue her and help her destroy the carnival. 

And ever since then, she has valued her family and friends a whole lot more. 

The moral of the story is...always be true to who you are AND most importantly, to the people you love.
