# Part A: Identify the First Act in your three favorite films.

Who is/are the main characters, and why do we care about them?

- H: We care about Harry because he is an ordinary person who is mistreated but has greatness within him -- a parallel to all of us. 
- L: We sympathize and/or empathize with the loss of her parents and her desire to connect with others. 
- N: We care about Marlin because he lost his son and Nemo because we've all been kids before, and -- despite differences in temperament -- we've all had moments of wanting to be our own person separate from what others wished for us to be. 

Where and when does the story take place?

- H: England / wizarding world 
- L: Hawaii 
- N: Great Barrier Reef / Australia 

How do we learn what type of movie it is?

- H: We see characters doing magic right at the beginning 
- L: We have a brief space scene which smoothly transitions into a scene in Hawaii
- N: we figure out immediately from the talking fish that it's a kids' movie

What is the inciting incident? (how is the world disrupted?)

- H: He finds out he is a wizard, and Voldemort returns. 
- L: Stitch lands on Earth
- N: He is captured by P. Sherman 

What or who is the antagonist?

- H: Voldy
- L: Gantu
- N: Darla 

# Part B: Now dream up what you want to present in the first act of your own film.
Ask yourself Who/What/When/Where

- Who: Parker, Selene, and Lang in the normal world, Katia and Tim in the world of the carnival

Try fitting it into the first three steps story spine, and flesh each step out with 3-4 sentencesâ€¦.

(This is somewhat difficult because it's sort of a conglomeration of two stories) 

1. Once upon a time, a girl was captured by an evil carnival and mind-controlled to serve its desires 
2. Every day, she would serve its purposes and gain greater magical skill, but have flashbacks to her old life and brief epiphanies that what she was doing was wrong -- before the mind control warped them again
3. Until one day, 3 friends came to rescue her, putting aside their own fears to destroy the entire carnival from the ground up.
