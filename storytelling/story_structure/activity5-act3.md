# Part A: Identify Act 3 in each of your three favorite films.

- What was the crisis?

H: Voldemort was trying to kill him via Quirrell

L: They were trying to take Stitch away

N: Almost losing Nemo / Dory

- How is it resolved?

H: The sorceror's stone appears in his pocket as he looks at the mirror 

L: She fights for Stitch using words ultimately 

N: Nemo rescues Dory

- How does the main character demonstrate that they learned what they needed?

H: His good intentions and good heart were what saved him. 

L: She learned to stand for her family -- and her words swaying the councilwoman's actions are what demonstrates this 

N: Marlin lets Nemo go into the fish net and take risks in general 

- What was the theme or moral?

H: Have a good heart, protect others

L: Family is the most important thing in the world, even if it's not a traditional family. 

N: Even when you love someone, you must let them live their lives and take risks -- and you must too 

- Was the character arc emotionally satisfying? Why or why not?

H: Yes since it teaches you to let the good inside of you overcome that which is evil -- compare Harry to Voldemort for the perfect contrast. 

L: Yes because it's a universal truth and made me think of my love for my own family 

N: Yes because it helped me to realize I can overcome fear

# Part B: Now develop the information you want to present in Act 3 of your own film.

- What is the crisis?

The Ringmaster is about to absorb all the souls into his body on the week before the Augenstorms. By doing so, all the people in the carnival will be lost forever. 

- How could it be resolved?

The souls need to be released from the Soulpool, and the Ringmaster himself must be killed somehow. Or at least driven far away. 

- How will the main character demonstrate that they learned what they needed? 

Parker, being the only one immune to hypnotic magic, must make the ultimate choice when Selene and Lang turn against him -- to attack, somehow, using his brains first and his magical ability second (since his mind is his strength).

- What is the theme or moral?

Overcome your fears, learn to trust, love, imagine, and dream 

- Do you think the audience will find the ending emotionally satisfying? Why?

Hopefully. If they are invested in Parker enough as a relatable character then they could relate it to their struggles and feel positive and empowered
