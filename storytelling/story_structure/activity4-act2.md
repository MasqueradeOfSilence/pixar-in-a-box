# Part A: Identify the Act 2 in your three favorite films.

- What is the want/goal of the main character(s) at the start of Act 2?

H: It depends on whether we are talking about the first movie or the series as a whole. 

First movie -- The troll is act 2. HP just wants to defeat the troll and get it out of the castle. 

L: She just wants Stitch to be part of her family. 

N: He wants to get out of the tank. 

- What (if any) is the point of no return or turning point (when the character learns something and changes their path)?

H: when they put Fluffy to sleep 

L: When she tells the Grand Councilwoman that if she takes Stitch, she's stealing. 

N: when they escape from the tank 

- What (if any) is the low point?

H: Fighting Voldy at the Mirror of Erised 

L: the aliens coming to take Stitch away

N: almost getting thrown in the trash, Dory almost getting taken away in the net 

- What did the character learn by the end of the second act?

H: courage

L: importance of family, how to teach S to care for others 

N: his dad learns to trust his son and to take risks (Marlin is more who learns in this film) but N also learns to take risks himself, despite what his dad says 

# Part B: Now develop the information you want to present in Act 2 of your own film.

- What is the want/goal of your main character(s) at the start of Act 2?

To destroy the evil carnival, but safely. 

- Why does your character reach a low point, if any?

Because the carnival is winning for much of the time. How could he ever hope to destroy something so powerful and ancient? 

- Describe the point of no return or turning point (where your character learns something new and realizes their needs.)

When he finally has the courage to plunge into the carnival full-time. 

- Try fitting this into the Act 2 steps of the story spine (fill each step out with 3-4 sentences.)

Because of that...they enter the carnival and befriend Katia + Tim

Because of that...K&T try to get them involved in their plot to gain more power, which teaches them more about the carnival

Because of that...they gain an understanding of how the carnival works...and thus how to destroy it...causing them to begin attacks on the rulers of the carnival.
