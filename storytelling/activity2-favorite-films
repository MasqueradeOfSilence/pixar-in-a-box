# Part A: Identify three films that you would take to a deserted island. 

1. Finding Nemo
2. Harry Potter (any of them)
3. Lilo and Stitch

I would also try to sneak Shrek, because Shrek is love and Shrek is life. 

# Part B: Why do you think you connected with these stories? Come up with at least one reason for each. 

1. Finding Nemo teaches us about courage, and of overcoming fears in order to help those we love. The former would be incredibly helpful on a deserted island; the latter if you were stranded alongside others. 
2. Harry Potter creates a beautiful world that I would love to live in, despite its dangers, and that could *technically* even be real. 
3. Lilo and Stitch has a lot of cool aliens. Additionally, it teaches us of the importance of family. 

# Part C: What, if anything, do these three films have in common? How are they different?

In common: They are all family movies. Harry Potter, however, is still more mature. Also, all of them have some element of unreality to them, which I like: talking fish, magical spells, and aliens from outer space.
