# Part A: In the above image, how is tone used to help create emphasis and direct the viewerâ€™s eye?

The lighting is pretty sharp, emphasizing that it's nighttime. The lamp itself is the brightest part of the scene, but we are conditioned to see lamps as background items, plus it's SO bright that our eyes are directed elsewhere. The rule of thirds, plus the sharp relief on Remy and Alfredo, puts the emphasis on them. We can see their strong emotions upon meeting each other -- Alfredo's surprise, and Remy's excitement. 

- What mood is conveyed?

Wonder, warmth, friendship

- What kind of contrast is used (low, higher, highest?)

Very high!
