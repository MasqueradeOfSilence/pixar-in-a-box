# Part A: In the above image, how is tone used to help create emphasis and direct the viewer’s eye?

The lighting is pretty sharp, emphasizing that it's nighttime. The lamp itself is the brightest part of the scene, but we are conditioned to see lamps as background items, plus it's SO bright that our eyes are directed elsewhere. The rule of thirds, plus the sharp relief on Remy and Alfredo, puts the emphasis on them. We can see their strong emotions upon meeting each other -- Alfredo's surprise, and Remy's excitement. 

- What mood is conveyed?

Wonder, warmth, friendship

- What kind of contrast is used (low, higher, highest?)

Very high! 

# Part B: Draw a row of 7 boxes. At one end, make the box as dark as possible. At the other end, leave the box empty. Fill in the rest of the boxes so that they gradually go from dark to light. You can do this with a pencil, pen, marker, paintbrush or anything else!

# Part C: On the sheet of paper you drew your movement lines, try adding shading to show different values of light and dark. Try to create emphasis and help direct your viewer’s eye to the most important element of your scene.
