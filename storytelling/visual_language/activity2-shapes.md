# Part A: Study the above image for a few minutes.

- Can you locate the main shapes in this image?

- How does shape influence where you look and what meaning and emotion is conveyed?

We first see Mike and Sully, but are quickly drawn to the shadow in the center. It's circular so it is not extremely threatening...but it's also much larger than Mike and Sully, so there is a degree of threat there. Sully looks a bit more powerful than Mike, but both appear tiny next to Boo. 

# Part B: Find a frame from one of your three favorite films. Notice how shapes are used.

- What are the unique characteristics that help establish the mood and story?

Lots of circles -- positive, cute scene. Bright colors against a beautiful backdrop of deep blue. Blurring in the background, with lots of straight lines, to show how fast they're going. 

- On a piece of paper, draw the composition using the simple shapes. Feel free to overlay each frame and trace on top of it with a highlighter.

# Part C: For your own story, identify the main shape for your main character(s).

- What does the shape of the character imply?

A narrow, bent-over rectangle: withdrawn, lacking confidence, anxious, but with inner strength. 

- Does their shape change over time?

The recetangle thickens and stands straighter up. 

- Put this character in a scene from your story and try sketching out the composition using simple shapes.

Scene: Parker, Selene, and Lang are standing off against Tenne the Ticketmaster.
