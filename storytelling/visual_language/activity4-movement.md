# Part A: What kind of movement (motion lines or line of action) is implied in the above images? Compare the role lines play in achieving a sense of movement in both.

1. Dynamic, very fast. There are speed lines that follow the cars, and speed lines on the road as well. Lines of action are straight but have a slight curve -- the key is that they point along the road
2. Much more localized and curvy movements than the Cars image. More fluid and organic. Lots of CURVES. While the Cars image looks like it could speed off the page, Remy looks like he could bounce, jump, wriggle, run, or walk off the page. He has access to much more detailed movements due to being a small mammal, especially as compared to a car (sentient and sapient or otherwise). 

# Part B: 

- On a piece of paper, try drawing motion lines that indicate the speed or direction of a simple shape (for example, a bouncing ball).

- Find a frame from one of your three favorite films which shows movement. On a sheet of paper, swiftly sketch the line(s) of action or motion lines that provide the sense of movement in the image.

# Part C:
- Draw a character from your story performing different movements. Use line of action to guide each pose.

Drawing humans is hard. Here are some Lang gestures

- Combine line of action in a character with motion lines to create a scene with lots of movement from your story. Donâ€™t be shy with your use of lines and shapes!
