# Part A: Study the above image for a few moments and then answer the following questions:

- How is the illusion of depth achieved?
- Are there any objects that show size differences?
- Can you see how shapes and lines contribute to the depth of this scene?
- Try answering the same questions using the frame you found from one of your favorite films.

# Part B: Try the following:

On a piece of paper, draw a horizontal line and place an “x” somewhere on it. This will be your vanishing point.

Now, draw squares of different sizes, some above, below, to the left and right of the vanishing point.

Using a ruler, connect the corners closest to the vanishing point with straight lines and see if you can establish a sense of depth.

Here is a partially finished example as a reference:

# Part C: Try creating an image from your original story that displays the illusion of depth using positioning, weight, location, and size of lines or objects.
