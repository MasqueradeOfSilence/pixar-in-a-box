# Part A: Study the above image for a few moments and then answer the following questions:

- How is the illusion of depth achieved?

1. The way the parking lot lines are slanted. 
2. Foreshortening of cars, small size differences in the farther away cars 
3. The way the Incredibles are standing in front of cars, buildings, trees, etc. but only partially. This helps us understand where they are in physical space, which implies depth. 
4. More blue the closer you get to the background, and the blue sky of course. 

- Are there any objects that show size differences?

1. Some of the cars are smaller than Mr. Incredible himself. While he's a big guy, he's not THAT big. This shows that he's in front of them. 
2. The buildings and windows are also small in comparison to the cars, and to the Incredibles themselves, which shows that they're in the background. 

- Can you see how shapes and lines contribute to the depth of this scene?

1. Slanted parking lot lines. 
2. The shapes of the Incredibles are much more organic, friendly, and fluid than the world of straight lines behind them. This, combined with the brighter colors of the Incredibles and a slight depth of field blurring effect, gives the illusion of depth. 

- Try answering the same questions using the frame you found from one of your favorite films.

1. Illusion of depth is created by the deep blue ocean behind them, in slightly different shades. 
2. Some turtles are farther away, so they are smaller, but they still have the proportions similar to Crush which is how we know they are adults -- thus maintaining the illusion of depth. 
3. The straight lines in the ocean show how fast they're moving. The darker patches (shapes) in the ocean look like the turtles' shadows, which adds to the depth of the scene. 

# Part B: Try the following:

On a piece of paper, draw a horizontal line and place an “x” somewhere on it. This will be your vanishing point.

Now, draw squares of different sizes, some above, below, to the left and right of the vanishing point.

Using a ruler, connect the corners closest to the vanishing point with straight lines and see if you can establish a sense of depth.

Here is a partially finished example as a reference:

I just did this in Drawabox lol. But sure, let's do it one more time for practice. 

I think this is upside down but whatever.

# Part C: Try creating an image from your original story that displays the illusion of depth using positioning, weight, location, and size of lines or objects.

It's a big...rough, and it shows some discrepancies in my figure drawing skills, but here we go:
