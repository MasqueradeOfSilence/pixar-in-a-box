I thought I did Part A of this activity already, but I appear to have lost it.

# Part A: In the above image, how is color used to help create emphasis and direct the viewer’s eye? What mood or emotion is conveyed? What kind of colors are used (similar, contrasting, complementary?)

There are contrasting colors. The right side of the frame is yellow and light, much like Ellie, representing hope and life. The rest of the room is blue, black, and gray, and comparatively dark. Carl sits on the bed facing towards the darkness, instead of looking towards the light. The emotions evoked are sadness, loneliness, hope, and empathy, as well as a desire for Carl to turn towards the light. 

# Part B: Looking at the frame from one of your favorite films, notice how color influences the emotional impact of the scene.

It's a happy, fun scene, even though Marlin looks a little nervous. The characters in the front look friendly, colorful, and bright, while still remaining accurate to reality. Bruce and the fish surrounding him are darker and bluer -- partly because of distance, partly because they are meant to look more foreboding. 

## With color pencils, pastels, crayons or markers on paper, create a version of this frame using different colors.

Pardon my colored penciling skills, which leave much to be desired.

## How does this change the meaning of the scene?

The idea was to make Crush, Squirt, Nemo, and Dory look evil and dark, whereas Bruce and the fish are supposed to look light, angelic, and happy. I may have cheated a little bit adding a halo on top of Bruce. 

# Part C: Return to your story spine from the previous lesson. For each beat, compose an image that directs the viewer’s eye, conveys meaning, expresses emotion, and supports your story point. This is where your understanding of visual language can start to shine through!

1. Once upon a time...there was a girl who was kidnapped by a demonic carnival that she was visiting with her family.

2. Every day...she would participate in the horrifying events of the carnival, growing in magical power, her memories wiped and brain mind-controlled to serve its purpose.

3. Until one day...an old friend of hers, plus 2 others, came into the carnival to meet with her and talk with her. While she could not remember her old friend, they still became friends once more.
