# Part A: How is line used to convey meaning and emotion within the frame below? Can you identify the primary direction of lines that direct your eyes to different parts of the frame?

This scene shows a happy moment between these characters. We see that Russell is happy to meet Dug, and Carl is pretty happy as well. 

I am sure that the blank expression on Kevin's face is still an expression of happiness in some way, shape, or form. 

Russell's face is directed towards Dug's directly, and vice versa. Also, Carl and Kevin are both happily looking at them. All the lines point towards R & D looking at each other, which emphasizes their positive emotions. 

Same with R & D's hands. (paws?)
