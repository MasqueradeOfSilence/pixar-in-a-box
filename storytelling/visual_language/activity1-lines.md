# Part A: How is line used to convey meaning and emotion within the frame below? Can you identify the primary direction of lines that direct your eyes to different parts of the frame?

This scene shows a happy moment between these characters. We see that Russell is happy to meet Dug, and Carl is pretty happy as well. 

I am sure that the blank expression on Kevin's face is still an expression of happiness in some way, shape, or form. 

Russell's face is directed towards Dug's directly, and vice versa. Also, Carl and Kevin are both happily looking at them. All the lines point towards R & D looking at each other, which emphasizes their positive emotions. 

Same with R & D's hands. (paws?) 

Here is a visual representation of what I see:

# Part B: On a blank sheet of paper write down two different feelings that youâ€™ve had recently (one at the bottom left, and the other at the bottom right). Visually represent the feeling on the left as a line traveling across the paper to the right. Then transform the line as it starts to take on characteristics of the feeling on the right. 

See below links

# Part C: Create a character with just one line and give it a name and short description. Try creating additional characters using multiple lines.

The following are sketchbook pages with the activity. They are not really optimized for github but can be downloaded and scrolled through / rotated
