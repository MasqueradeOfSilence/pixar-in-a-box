# Code your own simulation

This program simulates a particle falling due to gravity. Try changing the initial settings. What do you think will happen if you...

- Increase gravity? _This will speed up the particle as it falls. Making it negative will make it go up instead._
- Change the mass of the particle? _This will slow down the particle as it falls._
- Make the time step negative? _If you change the timestep from positive to negative as the physics simulation is running (it updates in real-time), you can cause the particle to bounce back up, effectively traveling backwards in time._
