# Hair Simulation 101

There were no deliverables in this section, just playing around with a mass-hair system with different parameters for various activities. 

There was a brief quiz on (Hooke's Law)[https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law].

Something interesting to me: A spring that has high stiffness and high displacement will generate a high amount of force. High stiffness means that it will be more difficult to stretch out. But if you have a high stiffness spring and a low stiffness spring, and you stretch them out to the same length, the high stiffness spring will be more forceful.
